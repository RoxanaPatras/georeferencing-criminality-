The poster shows exploratory research in georeferencing criminality hubs in late eighteenth and nineteenth-century Romanian Principalities (Moldavia and Walachia) and Transylvania by combining 7 layers of GIS data, with a view to showing the commitment to "strong factuality" (Lavocat 2020) in “hajduk” fiction, one of the most popular novel subgenres in modern Romanian literature. 

The 25 maps (7 selected for the poster) contain 6,826 documentary data points and 525 literary data points (for a total of 7,351 points), distributed as follows:
1.	Locations from the HaiRo corpus (labeled “Hajduk novels”): 596 data points, of which 525 are located within the historical regions of Romania.
2.	Post stations and inns from Austrian and Russian maps of the early 19th century (labeled “Poste Stations”): 267 data points.
3.	Monetary finds/Hoards (labeled “Monetary Finds”): 237 data points.
4.	Geographic descriptions of places related to criminal activity (labeled “Places geographic dictionary”): 27 data points.
5.	Late-18th- and early-19th-century Criminal Court Documents (labeled “Places Criminal Department of Moldova”): 310 data points.
6.	Forest Toponyms/Phytonyms (labeled “Forests…”): 910 for Moldavia; 2,971 for Wallachia; 478 for Transylvania; 872 for Oltenia (total: 5,231 data points).
7.	Travel accounts (labeled “Foreign Travellers in Romania”): 158 data points.

The project endeavors to build an interdisciplinary database that structures and networks information manually drawn from literary, law, historical, archeological, geographical, and toponymical fountains and to produce exploratory visualizations focused on clustering criminality hubs (hajduk robbery) with QGIS 3.42. The support map uploaded in QGIS dates from 1817-1820, it is commissioned by the administration of the Russian Empire, and covers not only Moldavia and Walachia, but also Transylvania, which was then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Excepting location data that derives from literary resources and travel accounts (retrieved subjectively or partially), factual data belongs to a relatively homogenous pool of archival resources, that is, a span of time of 100 years before the 48’ Revolution and the First Union of the Romanian Principalities (1859), when the political and social conditions in the 3 areas belong to the imperial paradigm. Boosting the national consciousness, the two historical events can be taken as a periodization marker because they lay ground for introducing new artistic and literary expressions, such as the very popular hajduk fiction.
